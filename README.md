The mobility management of our autonomous vehicle is based on the adaptation and engineering of systems on a pre-existing commercial platform, specifically the chassis of the 1:24 scale Soluna RC model. The choice of this 18 x 8.5 cm chassis is justified by its high-performance mechanical properties: it features a shock-resistant PVC structure ideal for withstanding potential impacts against the track's random walls and a compact design that facilitates navigation in confined spaces. For propulsion, the DC motors integrated into the original vehicle have been retained and implemented; although these motors are designed to reach speeds of up to 20 km/h in their factory configuration (Drift type), our technical implementation prioritizes control over top speed. By using an H-bridge controller and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal management from the source code, we limit the power delivered to an approximate 39% duty cycle (value 100/255). This electronic downshift is a critical engineering decision that transforms excess engine revolutions into manageable torque, preventing uncontrolled skidding on the track and ensuring that the vehicle's speed is compatible with the ultrasonic sensors' refresh rate.

The motion control logic operates under a reactive navigation scheme: upon detecting frontal obstacles within 20 cm, the system leverages the chassis' agility to perform a braking and reversing maneuver for one second, followed by a change of direction toward the area with greater clearance detected by the side sensors. Regarding component integration, a hybrid assembly has been implemented on the PVC body; while the battery and drivetrain remain in their original position to maintain a low center of gravity and mechanical stability, custom structures designed in CAD and manufactured using 3D printing have been added (see attached files). These printed parts function as mounting interfaces to hold the microcontroller and, fundamentally, to position the three ultrasonic sensors on the top of the chassis with precise and rigid angular alignment, ensuring reliable readings without altering the aerodynamics or weight distribution of the vehicle.
