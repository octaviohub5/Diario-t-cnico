The mobility management of our autonomous vehicle is based on the adaptation and engineering of systems on a pre-existing commercial platform, specifically the chassis of the 1:24 scale Soluna RC model. The choice of this 18 x 8.5 cm chassis is justified by its high-performance mechanical properties: it features a shock-resistant PVC structure ideal for withstanding potential impacts against the track's random walls and a compact design that facilitates navigation in confined spaces. For propulsion, the DC motors integrated into the original vehicle have been retained and implemented; although these motors are designed to reach speeds of up to 20 km/h in their factory configuration (Drift type), our technical implementation prioritizes control over top speed. By using an H-bridge controller and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) signal management from the source code, we limit the power delivered to an approximate 39% duty cycle (value 100/255). This electronic downshift is a critical engineering decision that transforms excess engine revolutions into manageable torque, preventing uncontrolled skidding on the track and ensuring that the vehicle's speed is compatible with the ultrasonic sensors' refresh rate.

The motion control logic operates under a reactive navigation scheme: upon detecting frontal obstacles within 20 cm, the system leverages the chassis' agility to perform a braking and reversing maneuver for one second, followed by a change of direction toward the area with greater clearance detected by the side sensors. Regarding component integration, a hybrid assembly has been implemented on the PVC body; while the battery and drivetrain remain in their original position to maintain a low center of gravity and mechanical stability, custom structures designed in CAD and manufactured using 3D printing have been added (see attached files). These printed parts function as mounting interfaces to hold the microcontroller and, fundamentally, to position the three ultrasonic sensors on the top of the chassis with precise and rigid angular alignment, ensuring reliable readings without altering the aerodynamics or weight distribution of the vehicle.

The vehicle's power management and sensor instrumentation have been designed using an architecture that ensures data integrity and autonomy during competition. A 2-cell (2S) Lithium Polymer (LiPo) battery with a capacity of 2800 mAh and a nominal voltage of 7.4V was selected as the primary power source. The choice of this specific battery, with a 45C discharge rate, is critical from an engineering perspective: this high discharge capacity ensures that the motors can handle current spikes during start-up and sharp turns without causing a voltage sag that could reset the microcontroller. To manage this power efficiently, the control logic is not powered directly from the battery; instead, a Buck DC-DC converter (model LM2596) is implemented to reduce and regulate the 7.4V voltage to a stable 5V level for the ESP32 microcontroller and the sensors. The use of this switched-mode regulator, visible in the central chassis mount, is superior to traditional linear regulators because it minimizes energy dissipation as heat, maximizing the vehicle's run time on the track. Furthermore, the motors' energy consumption is optimized by software using a 39% PWM signal (value 100), preventing unnecessary battery drain by limiting the average current delivered to the actuators without sacrificing the torque required for mobility.
Regarding sensor management, the vehicle implements a perception system using three ultrasonic sensors arranged in a fan configuration (left, center, right). These sensors were selected for their reliability in detecting the rigid walls of the track at the required operating distance of 20 cm. However, the engineering challenge of using multiple ultrasonic sensors simultaneously is interference or "crosstalk." To address this, our control algorithm implements sequential triggering: the microcontroller activates the front sensor's trigger, waits for its echo, calculates the distance, and only then proceeds to activate the side sensors. This communication protocol, which includes micro-stabilization delays (delayMicroseconds), ensures that the echo received by a sensor corresponds exclusively to its own emitted pulse and not to a bounce from an adjacent sensor, guaranteeing a clean and accurate reading of the environment. This orchestration between efficient power management through switched regulation and sequential sensor reading allows the vehicle to maintain a robust autonomous state, processing complex navigation decisions without false positives and with a stable power supply.
